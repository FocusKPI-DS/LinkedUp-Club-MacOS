# This is a placeholder for a notification sound
# In a real implementation, you would:
# 1. Download a free notification sound from freesound.org
# 2. Convert it to MP3 format
# 3. Place it in this directory
# 4. Update pubspec.yaml to include it in assets

# For now, the system will use the default macOS notification sound
# which is actually better for user experience!
